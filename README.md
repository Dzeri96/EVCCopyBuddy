# EVC Copy Buddy

A dirty bash script that copies Bewertungssheet.xlsx and a Anmerkungen.txt file to each student's subdirectory (containing their submission). The script also takes the last 8 letters from the folder path and adds them to the copied files' names. These 8 letters should be the MNR of each student.

## Using the script
Simply copy the .bat file to a folder containing Bewertungssheet.xlsx and all of the students' subfolders (usually generated by the extract script). The Anmerkungn.txt will be automatically generated.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
submission_talks/
├── EVCCopyBuddy.bat
├── Bewertungssheet.xlsx
├── 01234567
│   ├── bsp1/
│   ├── bsp2/
│   └── bsp3/
└── 11234567/
    └── ...
```

Just double-click the .bat file or open it trough a shell to see the output. The script should not overrite existing files (Bewertungssheet or Anmerkungen) in those subdirectories.

Still, USE WITH CAUTION, I HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH BATCH SCRIPTS!
